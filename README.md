# Obstacle Race game

A Obstacle course game where the player has to avoid boxes and collect coins
to get the highest score ,each tick in the game is 5 points and each coin worth 10 points.

you can play in two modes:
- buttons mode: you play using 2 buttons and move the car left and right

- Sensors mode: mode when there are no buttons, you change lanes by tilting the phone left/ right
 and also controlling the speed by tilting forwards or backwards
 (towards you go faster and backwards you go slower )

In building this game, I used:

- Signal management (SignalManager for toast and vibrate)

- sound management (singleSoundPlayer for sound effects)

- Google Maps platform for the map (android app API)

- FusedLocation (for the location and GPS access)

- using Gson (for the Shared preferences)

- Glide for loading the background image at the start
